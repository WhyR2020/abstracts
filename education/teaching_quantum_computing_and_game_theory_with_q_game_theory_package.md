# Teaching quantum computing and game theory with QGameTheory package

Authors: Indranil Ghosh (Jadavpur University) 

# Description 

The QGameTheory package (CRAN: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/QGameTheory/index.html) (GitHub: https://github.com/indrag49/QGameTheory) is a toolbox that can be used to study and practice the basic concepts of quantum computing and quantum game theory with the R language. One can use it to design simple quantum circuits and also use functionalities that simulate several quantum game theory models. The presentation will start with introducing basic simulations of quantum gates and quantum circuits  with the package, before using it to work with important quantum game theoretic models like Quantum Prisoner's dilemma, Quantum Penny Flip game and more.
