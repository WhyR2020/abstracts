# Agent-based modeling with RCpp

Authors: Jeremiah Reyes (Statista) 

# Description 

I present an agent-based model (ABM) with R and C++ (via RCpp) that uses an AI framework called Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP). Agent-based modeling is a method that simulates "agents" with specific behaviors interacting inside a virtual environment. Meanwhile, GOAP is an artificial-intelligence framework originally developed in the computer games industry where agents have goals, actions, and an "action planner" that selects and sequences actions in order to attain the currently chosen goal. The combination of R and C++ is ideal for such kind of agent-based modeling because R can easily handle, manipulate, and analyze large-scale data while C++ can address the computationally expensive aspects of the AI framework.
