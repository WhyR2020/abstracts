# Description 

In this presentation, I would like to present general view on the utility of statistical inference, supported by R to analyze Big Data sets. There is definitely too much hoopla about AI and Big Data these days and not enough serious inferential models. Part of the blame falls on the shoulders of us, statisticians. But there is a silver lining to this cloud. It is called functional data analysis. And, hey, this will be the topic of my talk.
