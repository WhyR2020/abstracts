# Description 

The R package mlr3shiny provides a simple accessible and user-friendly

web-application, combining the graphical user interface (GUI) offered by Shiny with

the state-of-the-art machine learning functionalities provided by mlr3. The resulting application enables users to set up basic machine learning workflows in a very fast way while familiarizing with the core steps of a machine learning process. As such, users unfamiliar with R or coding can reference and apply modern ML functionalities in an easy to use point-and-click fashion and dive into the universe of machine learning. Especially the latter makes this new package also a valuable tool to be used for teaching introductory ML courses.
